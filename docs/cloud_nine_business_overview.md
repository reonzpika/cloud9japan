## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tight Timeline (23 days to messe)
**Impact:** Risk of incomplete preparation
**Solution:** 
- Prioritize working shop over perfect tech (Shopify first, custom integration later)
- Mum focuses only on products and Instagram content
- Son handles all tech/setup
- Accept "good enough" over "perfect"

### Challenge 2: Broken Cart Functionality
**Impact:** Can't sell online yet
**Solution:**
- Hybrid approach: Beautiful manus.im site links to Shopify store
- Shopify handles cart/checkout (proven, reliable)
- Integrate properly after messe when less pressure

### Challenge 3: Low Instagram Presence (24 followers, 15 posts)
**Impact:** Limited pre-messe awareness
**Solution:**
- Daily posting + stories
- Follow horse-related accounts (200-300)
- Active engagement (likes/comments on horse posts)
- Behind-the-scenes content to build connection
- Hashtag strategy for discoverability

### Challenge 4: Design Placement Feedback
**Impact:** Current centered placement may look less premium
**Solution:**
- Created suggestion document for asymmetric placement
- Recommend corner/side placement for more sophisticated look
- Directional rule: horse facing right → place on left (and vice versa)
- Let mum decide final approach

### Challenge 5: First-Time Shopify API Integration
**Impact:** Unknown technical complexity, time sink
**Solution:**
- Delay custom integration until after messe
- Use standard Shopify for now (de-risk)
- Son is technical and experienced with AI-assisted coding (Cursor)
- Can tackle integration in March with less time pressure

### Challenge 6: Undefined Messe Logistics
**Impact:** Could scramble last-minute
**Solution:**
- Checklist created for mum to confirm logistics by Feb 10
- Includes: setup time, booth specs, power, parking, display needs
- Better to over-prepare than under-prepare
